## *2023 University of Wroclaw course*
### P1 (Randomized and search algorithms) 
- **z1.py**  solution to cooperative rook & king mate [(CodinGame)](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/cooperative-mate-with-rook)
- **z2.py**  given set of words and text without spaces, add spaces (maximizing length)
- **z3.py**  simulation to determine poker probabilities
- **z4.py, z5.py** - (simplified) Nonogram solver (WalkSat inspired)
### P2 (A* algorithm, reduction of uncertainty)
- **komandos.py**  solution to commando puzzle using random/heuristic moves in order to reduce uncertainty, and BFS with node pruning
- **komandos2.py**  solution to commando puzzle using A* search, with admissible/non-admissible heuristic
- **nonograms.py**  general Nonogram solver (WalkSat inspired)
- **sokoban.py** solution to sokoban puzzle
### P3 (Constraint satisfaction problems, backtracking)
- **nonograms.py**  Nonogram solver using CSP and backtracking
- **sudoku.py**  python program, which given sudoku puzzle, generates code for SWI-PROLOG, which solves the problem 
- **storms.py** python program, which given storms puzzle, generates code for SWI-PROLOG, which solves the problem 
### P4 (Reversi, Jungle, Chess agents in works)
